Conclusion/Recommendations:
Data demonstrates a strong correlation between the number of steps taken and the number of calories consumed and as a result, if users want to burn calories they should be encouraged to be mindful of the number of steps they are taking for the day. Because the demand for weight loss products is a rapidly growing trend, marketing campaigns about smart devices should explain the relationship between step-taking and calorie expenditure and how users can make use of the features to get the most out of both activities. Data also indicates that smart device users like to engage in physical activities that are low in intensity and require movement between short distances. The best way to make use of this analysis is to identify the consumer segment that regularly uses smart devices as those that prefer activities and sports that don't require much physical exertion and distance movement (pickleball, water polo, jogging, golf, nature walking, etc). Bellabeat should identify users who demonstrate their interest in these activities and exclusively market towards these types of consumers.
